Unlimited concurrent connections to SQL Server could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks. \n  \nThis requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts. \n  \nThe capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to SQL Server (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to SQL Server by other means. \n  \nThe organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session. \n  \n(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-93825","V-79119"],"ccis":["CCI-000054"],"reference_identifier":"3993","uuid":"a8fe8836-cf4c-45d1-833f-e595024f7f4b","stig_uuid":"ceb8b7de-00af-417c-b695-23123a9ca06d","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":""},{"group_id_src":"V-213930","group_tree":[{"id":"V-213930","title":"SRG-APP-000023-DB-000001","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-213930","severity":"high","group_title":"SQL Server must integrate with an organization-level authentication/access mechanism providing account management and automation for all users, groups, roles, and any other principals.","rule_id_src":"SV-213930r879522_rule","rule_id":"SV-213930r879522","rule_version":"SQL6-D0-003700","rule_title":"SQL Server must integrate with an organization-level authentication/access mechanism providing account management and automation for all users, groups, roles, and any other principals.","fix_text":"If mixed mode is required, document the need and justification; describe the measures taken to ensure the use of SQL Server authentication is kept to a minimum; describe the measures taken to safeguard passwords; list or describe the SQL Logins used.\n\nRisk must be accepted by the ISSO/ISSM. \n \nIf mixed mode is not required, disable it as follows:  \n \nIn the SSMS Object Explorer, right-click on the server instance. \nSelect \"Properties\".  \nSelect the Security page.  \nClick on the radio button for \"Windows Authentication Mode\".  \nClick on \"OK\".  \nRestart the SQL Server instance.  \n \nOR  \n \nRun the statement:  \nUSE [master] \nEXEC xp_instance_regwrite N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', N'Software\\Microsoft\\MSSQLServer\\MSSQLServer', N'LoginMode', REG_DWORD, 2 \nGO \n \nRestart the SQL Server instance.  \n \nFor each account being managed by SQL Server but not requiring it, drop or disable the SQL Login.

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. \n \nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). \n \nThis requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process. \n \nSQL Server will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update.
