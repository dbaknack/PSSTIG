A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. \r\n\r\nExamples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in noncentralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.\r\n\r\nSQL Server must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. \r\n\r\nAutomation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together, contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.","false_positives":"\n","false_negatives":"\n","documentable":"\nfalse","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"\n","third_party_tools":"\n","ia_controls":"\n","responsibility":"\n","mitigations":"\n","mitigation_control":"\n","legacy_ids":["SV-93767","V-79061"],"ccis":["CCI-000015"],"reference_identifier":"3992","uuid":"0c52e340-a454-4e3b-a9a4-b5db04b8c076","stig_uuid":"44fb3922-d6dd-48c3-8dd8-21f788c33f18","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":""},{"group_id_src":"V-213901","group_tree":[{"id":"V-213901","title":"SRG-APP-000033-DB-000084","description":"<GroupDescription>\n</GroupDescription>\n"}],"group_id":"V-213901","severity":"high","group_title":"SQL Server must enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.","rule_id_src":"SV-213901r879530_rule","rule_id":"SV-213901r879530","rule_version":"SQL6-D0-000300","rule_title":"SQL Server must enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.","fix_text":"Use GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, ALTER ROLE … ADD MEMBER … and/or ALTER ROLE ….

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. \r\n\r\nSuccessful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. \r\n\r\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. \r\n\r\nThis requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems.  If SQL Server does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.","false_positives":"\n","false_negatives":"\n","documentable":"\nfalse","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"\n","third_party_tools":"\n","ia_controls":"\n","responsibility":"\n","mitigations":"\n","mitigation_control":"\n","legacy_ids":["SV-93771","V-79065"],"ccis":["CCI-000213"],"reference_identifier":"3992","uuid":"045c6ea9-7c87-49e1-8855-d9c961b89014","stig_uuid":"44fb3922-d6dd-48c3-8dd8-21f788c33f18","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":""},{"group_id_src":"V-213902","group_tree":[{"id":"V-213902","title":"SRG-APP-000080-DB-000063","description":"<GroupDescription>\n</GroupDescription>\n"}],"group_id":"V-213902","severity":"high","group_title":"SQL Server must protect against a user falsely repudiating by ensuring only clearly unique Active Directory user accounts can connect to the database.","rule_id_src":"SV-213902r879554_rule","rule_id":"SV-213902r879554","rule_version":"SQL6-D0-000400","rule_title":"SQL Server must protect against a user falsely repudiating by ensuring only clearly unique Active Directory user accounts can connect to the database.","fix_text":"\nRemove all users that were returned in the check SQL Statement:\r\n\r\nSELECT name\r\nFROM sys.database_principals\r\nWHERE type in ('U','G')\r\nAND name LIKE '%$'\r\n\r\nTo remove users:\r\n\r\nRun the following command for each user:\r\n\r\nDROP USER [ IF EXISTS ] <user_name>\n;\n","weight":"10.0","check_content":"\nExecute the following query:\r\n\r\nSELECT name\r\nFROM sys.database_principals\r\nWHERE type in ('U','G')\r\nAND name LIKE '%$'\r\n\r\nIf no users are returned, this is not a finding.\r\n\r\nIf users are returned, determine whether each user is a computer account.\r\n\r\nLaunch PowerShell.\r\n\r\nExecute the following code:\r\n\r\nNote: <name>\n represents the username portion of the user.
